# AI-POWERED SMART FIRST AID APP

👨🏻‍💻I built this _"AI POWERED SMART FIRST AID APP"_ using Flutter and Firebase. 

**✨Features:-**

**🔐Secure User Authentication:** Developed a comprehensive authentication system using Firebase, enabling secure user registration and login.

**📊Symptom Analysis and Information:** Implemented a feature where users can input their symptoms and receive detailed information, including causes, effects, remedies, important notes, and additional health tips.

**📱Dynamic AI Chatbot:** Integrated a chatbot powered by Google's Gemini API, allowing users to ask health-related questions and receive real-time, AI-driven responses.

**📜Health Blogs and ⌛Quick Reference:** Created a blog page for users to access health-related articles and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, a "Quick Sheet" page provides a list of common symptoms and suggested medicines for quick reference.

**Note:** 
- If you intend to run this source code on your system, ensure you add the `firebase_options.dart` file and include the API key for Gemini.
- This repository does not include the complete Flutter project structure required to run the application according to the official Flutter ecosystem guidelines. It contains only the necessary source code, assets, and the `pubspec.yaml` file for the project.
